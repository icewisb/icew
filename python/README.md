# 1 The Origins of Python
**Some changes in Python 3.0**
- Print is now a function
- Views and iterators instead of lists
- The rules for ordering comparisons have been simplified. E.g. a heterogeneous list cannot be sorted, because all the elements of a list must be comparable to each other.
- There is only one integer type left, i.e. int. long is int as well.
- The division of two integers returns a float instead of an integer. "//" can be used to have the "old" behaviour.
- Text Vs. Data Instead Of Unicode Vs. 8-bit
-  exit without brackets works in Python2.x but doesn't work anymore in Python3.x

# 2 Starting with Python: The Interactive Shell
- Strings are immutable
